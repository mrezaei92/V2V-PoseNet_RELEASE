**PyTorch re-implementation of the V2V-PoseNet is available at dragonbook's [repo](https://github.com/dragonbook/V2V-PoseNet-pytorch).**

Thanks dragonbook for re-implementation. Other versions of the V2V-PoseNet are also welcome!

# Introduction

This is our project repository for the paper, **V2V-PoseNet: Voxel-to-Voxel Prediction Network for Accurate 3D Hand and Human Pose Estimation from a Single Depth Map ([CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com))**.

We, **Team SNU CVLAB**, (<i>Gyeongsik Moon, Juyong Chang</i>, and <i>Kyoung Mu Lee</i> of [**Computer Vision Lab, Seoul National University**](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/)) are **winners** of [**HANDS2017 Challenge**](http://icvl.ee.ic.ac.uk/hands17/challenge/) on frame-based 3D hand pose estimation.

# About our code
## Dependencies
* [Torch7](http://torch.ch)
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
* [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

Our code is tested under Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 environment with Titan X GPUs (12GB VRAM).

## Code
Clone this repository into any place you want. You may follow the example below.
```bash
makeReposit = [/the/directory/as/you/wish]
mkdir -p $makeReposit/; cd $makeReposit/
git clone https://github.com/mks0601/V2V-PoseNet_RELEASE.git
```
* `src` folder contains lua script files for data loader, trainer, tester and other utilities.
* `data` folder contains data converter which converts image files to the binary files.

To train our model, please run the following command in the `src` directory:

```bash
th rum_me.lua
```

* There are some optional configurations you can adjust in the config.lua. 
* You have to convert the `.png` images of the ICVL, NYU, and HANDS 2017 dataset to the `.bin` files by running the code from `data` folder.
* The directory where you have to put the dataset files and computed centers of each frame is defined in `src/data/dataset_name/data.lua`
* Visualization code is finally uploaded! You have to prepare 'result_pixel.txt' for each dataset. Each row of the result file has to contain the pixel coordinates of x, y and depth of all joints (i.e, x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ...). Then run pixel2world script and run draw_DB.m

# Dataset
We trained and tested our model on the four 3D hand pose estimation and one 3D human pose estimation datasets.

# Results
Here we provide the precomputed centers, estimated 3D coordinates and pre-trained models of ICVL, NYU, MSRA, HANDS2017, and ITOP datasets. You can download precomputed centers and 3D hand pose results in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1moW1nkL7Ey6C_6XAEQbWZEIoZN1uxlfu?usp=sharing) and pre-trained models in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtzflL_F0Hird4fj9lpofqhjeGNQnOap?usp=sharing)

The precomputed centers are obtained by training the hand center estimation network from [DeepPrior++ ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.08325.pdf). Each line represents 3D world coordinate of each frame.
In case of ICVL, NYU, MSRA, and HANDS2017 dataset, if depth map not exist or not contain hand, that frame is considered as invalid.
In case of ITOP dataset, if 'valid' variable of a certain frame is false, that frame is considered as invalid.
All test images are considered as valid.

The 3D coordinates estimated on the ICVL, NYU and MSRA datasets are pixel coordinates and the 3D coordinates estimated on the HANDS2017 and ITOP datasets are world coordinates. The estimated results are from ensembled model. You can make the results from a single model by downloading the pre-trained model and testing it.

We used [awesome-hand-pose-estimation ](https://github.com/xinghaochen/awesome-hand-pose-estimation) to evaluate the accuracy of the V2V-PoseNet on the ICVL, NYU and MSRA dataset.

Belows are qualitative results.
